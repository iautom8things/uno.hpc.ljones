Greetings Folks,

So before things get really crazy with there being a half-dozen different versions of the code floating around, I set up a git repository for our Leonard Jones problem.

If you just want to poke around, go here:

https://github.com/mazubieta/uno.hpc.ljones.git

If you want to contribute, register to github, if you haven't already and fire me an email with your username on github. I'll add you as a contributor asap.

If you are totally unfamiliar and want a horrible crash course, here are the main commands you'll need:

First, install git:

Linux:
$ sudo apt-get install git

Mac, Download and install this:
http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

Windows:
GTFO

Navigate to a folder you'd like to develop in:

$ git clone git://github.com/mazubieta/uno.hpc.ljones.git

BAAM! You've got the latest code.

Let's say you add this incredible file (fmanny.c) that fixes some of my fugly code, and you want everyone to see:

$ git add fmanny.c

This tells git that you want it to watch this file.

Now you're ready to show the world:

$ git commit -m 'fixed manuels garbage-of-a-code'

$ git push origin master //I'm actually not sure about this. I'll get back to you

Want to check that your change was made?

$ git log

If you ever forget a git command:

$ git help

Or if you want more info on a command, add --help to it, like this:

$ git pull --help

All other commands are considered magic, and too complex for even the likes of me.
